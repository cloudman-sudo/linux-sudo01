DEVOPS

1. devops --> intersection of dev & Ops


2. typical software release process
				+----------------+
--------------------------------| initial launch |
				+----------------+
				
idea --> requirements --> code --> test it --> build nd package --> deploy it --> operate nd monitor

3. software versioning 
	1.4.2
    major|	

4. continuous delivery
			
			idea --> implement --> test --> build
			 ^				  |
			 |				  v
			 +---------- observe	 <----- deploy 	
			 
5. DevOps 
	- devops is about making this process [ continuous delivery ]
		- making the process fast
		- with minimal bugs
		
6. Challenges DevOps tries to solve
	1. Frictions and roadblocks in release process
		- slowing down the process
		- too much effort
		- errors slipping through
	    -> miscommunications and lack of collaboration
	    -> conflict of interest
	    -> security
	    -> application testing
	    
7. Dev Sec Ops

	DevOps     --> removing any roadblocks
	DevSecOps  --> highlight the importance of integrating security

Software development lifecycle - SDLC
1. Plan
2. Implement
3. Test
4. Deploy
5. Maintain

complete software development process
1. Programming
2. Software Testing
3. Release of Software
	- build application
	- run on servers
	- upgrade existing software
4. operations
	- run software on production

# need by operations:	
	-no downtime
	-handle huge traffic

Waterfall vs Agile
	Traditional waterfall:
		- requirements
		- development
		- testing
		- operations
		
		# ineffective process
		# over time new requirements may arise
		# many places of failure and miscommunication
		# no fast
		
	Agile:
		# benefits of agile
		# speed of development, testing and deployment cycles
			# each feature get tested, deployed
			# immediate feedback
			# fast development and deployment process
			# scrum and kanban --specific implementations
			
		# continuous integration
		# continuous delivery
