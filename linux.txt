Operating System

OS
	- Translator
	- Manages Resources among applications
	- isolated content of applications
	
OS tasks

1. Resource allocation and management
	- CPU | Memory | storage | I/O devices

    # CPU
	  - Process Management
	  What is process
	  - small unit that executes on the computer
	  - each process has own isolated space
	  
	  1 CPU
	   - 1 process at a time
	   - 1 cpu can only process 1 task at a time
	   - cpu is switching content so fast that you don't notice it
	  
	  Multiple CPU
	   - Dual-core = 2 CPUs
	   - Quad-core = 4 CPUs
	   the more cpu's the faster the applications work
   # Memory
   	- Memory Management
   	  - allocating working memory
   	  - every application needs some data to work
   	  - RAM is limited on the computer
   	  
   	 - Memory Swapping
   	   - OS swaps memory between applications
   	   - one app becomes inactive, new one gets resources
   	   - slow down the computer
   	   
   	   
   	   Memory swapping
   	   
   	   +-----+              swap-out
   	   | Ram | Process P1 ------------------> 
   	   +-----+
   	   
   	   
	   +-----+       swap-out
   	   | Ram |------------------> Process P1
   	   +-----+
   	   
   	   
   	   +-----+       swap-out		 +---------+
   	   | Ram |------------------> Process P1 | Storage | (Secondary memory)
   	   +-----+				 +---------+	
   	   
   	   
   	   
   	   +-----+       swap-out		 +---------+
   	   | Ram | -----------------> 		 | Storage | Process P1
   	   +-----+ <---------------- Process P2  +---------+	
   	   		swap-in
   	   		
   	   		

	   +-----+       swap-out		 +---------+
   	   | Ram | -----------------> 		 | Storage | Process P1
   	   +-----+ <----------------             +---------+	
   	   Process P2		 swap-in
   	   
   	   	- that process takes some time
   	   	
     RAM = working memory
     - actively processing data
     
    # Storage Management
     - also called "secondary memory"
     - persisting data long-term
     - hard drive
     
     vs code ---- loaded into memory ----> RAM
     
     Storage <------save permanently -- RAM [ VS code ]
     
     RAM <------load all the saved data --- storage
     
3. Manage File System
     	- stored in a structured way
     	- in Unix systems [ mac os, linux ]  : tree file system
     		[/]
     		 |----[]
     		 |----[]
     	- in windows OS: multiple root folders
     		[A:]			[C:]
     		 |-----[]		 |-----[]
     		 |-----[]		 |-----[]
     		 
4. Management of I/O Devices
	- monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, external hard-drive
	- OS knows how to handle and translate interactions between apps and devices

5. Security and networking
